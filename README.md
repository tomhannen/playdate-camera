This is a web application in a single 'index.html' page that allows you to take 1-bit dithered 400x240 PNG photos from your phone/computer camera.
Make sure to give permissions for camera use, and then you should be able to save the file once it has been captured.
Works in portrait or landscape.
Hopefully it will be useful to people who want to build things for the Playdate console.
It was created using Claude Code on an iPhone. Tested in Mobile Safari and Brave desktop browsers only.
